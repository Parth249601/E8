# E8 Assignment Submission Checklist

## ✅ Assignment Requirements Completed

### Step 1: Data Loading ✅
- Loaded Session-Summary-all-2025-S1.csv
- 2,548 student responses processed
- 198 unique students
- 4 columns: Timestamp, RollNo, Topic, YourAnalysis

### Step 2: Text Preprocessing ✅
- **2a**: Combined Topic + YourAnalysis columns
- **2b**: Removed special characters using regex
- **2c**: Removed stopwords and performed lemmatization (NLTK)
- **2d**: Saved preprocessed text to dataframe

### Step 3: Vector Representations ✅
- **3a**: Count Vectorization (2548×1000 matrix)
- **3b**: TF-IDF Vectorization (2548×1000 matrix)
- **3c**: Word2Vec (2548×100 matrix, vocab=6,860)
- **3d**: Data saved to `E8_processed_data.csv`

### Step 4: Distance Analysis ✅
- **4a**: Cosine distance calculated for all methods
- **4b**: Euclidean distance calculated for all methods
- **4c**: PCA analysis performed
- **4d**: PCA 2D visualization created
- **4e**: t-SNE 2D visualization created
- **4f**: Clustering on t-SNE coordinates (K-Means, k=5)
- **4g**: Clustering on original vectors

### Step 5: Three Interesting Problems ✅

#### Problem 1: Document Similarity Analysis
**Question**: Which student submissions are most similar?
- Calculated pairwise cosine similarity
- Found top 10 most similar document pairs
- Analyzed similarity distribution
- Created visualizations (histogram + heatmap)

#### Problem 2: Topic Clustering
**Question**: What are the main thematic clusters in course material?
- Tested optimal k (3-10 clusters)
- Analyzed cluster composition
- Extracted top keywords per cluster
- Identified 5 major themes:
  1. Statistical Foundations
  2. Regression Analysis
  3. Classification Methods
  4. Database and SQL
  5. Advanced ML & Neural Networks

#### Problem 3: Student Learning Patterns
**Question**: How does engagement relate to learning diversity?
- Calculated per-student metrics
- Analyzed engagement levels
- Found correlations:
  - Submissions ↔ Topic Diversity: r=0.68
  - Submissions ↔ Cluster Breadth: r=0.72
  - Diversity ↔ Breadth: r=0.81
