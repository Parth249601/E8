## CHEA GAMES

### Game 1: The Lockbox Race

Small teams of five to six students are formed, and each team receives an identical box secured with multiple, varied padlocks (e.g., a 4-digit number lock, a 4-letter word lock, a standard key lock). A series of interconnected puzzles are hidden on and around their designated table. Solving these puzzles reveals the combinations and keys needed to open the box. The first team to unlock their box and claim the prize inside wins. This transforms a complex activity into a fast-paced, collaborative race.

#### What You'll Need
* 3-4 different types of low-cost padlocks (e.g., number, letter, key).
* Need to ideate on puzzles for 4 teams.

### Game 2: Charades Down the Line

The audience is divided into two or more large teams (8-10 people per team), who then form lines. The first person in each line is shown the same complex, multi-part phrase. They must then act it out for the second person in line, who in turn acts out their interpretation for the third, and so on down the line. The final person must guess the original phrase.

#### How to Play
1.  **Team Formation:** Divide the room into 2-4 large teams. Have each team form a single-file line, with all members facing forward so they cannot see the person behind them.
2.  **The Reveal:** The first person from each team approaches the facilitator, who simultaneously shows them the secret phrase.
3.  **The Relay Begins:** The players return to the front of their lines, tap the second person's shoulder to get their attention, and then act out the phrase using standard charades rules (no words, sounds, or props).
4.  **Down the Line:** Player 2 taps Player 3 and acts out what they believe they just saw. This continues down the line. The primary source of humor is the inevitable and bizarre mutation of the original action as it is reinterpreted by each player.

#### Ideas
* "A clumsy octopus trying to win a tennis match against a robot."
* "A nervous wizard attempting to bake a birthday cake for a dragon."
* "A penguin winning an Olympic gold medal for synchronized swimming."

### Game 3: Telephone Pictionary

1.  Everyone sits in a circle and writes a funny or unusual sentence on the first page of their booklet.
2.  Everyone passes their booklet to the person on their left.
3.  Each person now reads the sentence they received, flips to the next page, and does their best to draw a picture of that sentence.
4.  After a set time (e.g., one minute), players fold the original sentence back so it's hidden, leaving only the drawing visible.
5.  Everyone passes the booklet to their left again.
6.  The next person looks only at the drawing and, on the following page, writes a sentence describing what they think the drawing depicts.
7.  This process of alternating between drawing and writing continues until the booklets return to their original owners.
8.  One by one, each person shares the hilarious evolution of their original phrase with the group.

### Game 4: Two Truths and a Lie (Stage Edition)

#### The Big Idea
A classic icebreaker adapted for a larger audience. A few volunteers come on stage and share three "facts" about themselves—two true, one false. The audience gets to play detective, asking questions and voting on which statement is the lie. It’s a fantastic way to learn surprising things about people and engage the entire room in a collective guessing game.

#### How to Play
1.  Invite a few volunteers to the stage.
2.  One at a time, each volunteer presents three statements about themselves in any order: two truths and one lie. The best lies are believable, and the best truths are often surprising.
3.  The host can allow the audience to ask clarifying "lie detector" questions to the volunteer to get more details.
4.  After the questioning, the audience votes on which statement they believe is the lie.
5.  The volunteer reveals the lie, often with a short, entertaining story behind one of the truths.

### Game 5: Who Am I? / Celebrity Heads

#### The Big Idea
A classic guessing game that puts players in the hot seat. Each participant has the name of a famous person, character, or object stuck to their forehead or back, which they can't see. The game is highly interactive and amusing for the audience, who can see all the identities and enjoy the players' questions and wrong guesses.

#### What You'll Need
* Sticky notes or index cards.
* Pens or markers.

#### How to Play
1.  Prepare sticky notes with the names of well-known people or characters (e.g., Harry Potter, Taylor Swift, Albert Einstein).
2.  As guests arrive or when the game starts, stick one note on each person's forehead or back without them seeing it.
3.  Players then mingle and ask others "yes" or "no" questions to figure out their own identity. For example: "Am I a fictional character?" or "Am I a musician?"
4.  The goal is to be the first to guess your identity. Alternatively, it can be played non-competitively until everyone has figured out who they are.
