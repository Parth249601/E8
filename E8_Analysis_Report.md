#### 4a. Cosine Distance
- Measures angular similarity between document vectors
- Values range from 0 (identical) to 1 (orthogonal)
- TF-IDF shows best separation with mean distance of 0.7892

#### 4b. Euclidean Distance
- Measures straight-line distance in vector space
- Count vectorization shows largest distances due to sparse high-dimensional space
- Word2Vec provides more compact representation

- **Purpose**: Reduce dimensionality while preserving variance
- **Findings**:
  - Count vectors: Highly concentrated (1 component for 90%)
  - TF-IDF: More distributed (38 components needed)
  - Word2Vec: Naturally lower dimension (12 components)

#### 4d. PCA 2D Visualization
- Projects documents onto 2 principal components
- Reveals document clustering patterns
- TF-IDF and Word2Vec show clearer separation

#### 4e. t-SNE 2D Visualization
- Non-linear dimensionality reduction
- Better preserves local structure
- All methods show 5-7 distinct clusters
- Silhouette scores 0.39-0.45 indicate moderate cluster quality

#### 4f. t-SNE Clustering
- Applied K-Means clustering (k=5) on t-SNE coordinates
- Best silhouette score: 0.4523 (TF-IDF)
- Clusters correspond to major topic areas

#### 4g. Original Vector Clustering
- K-Means on full-dimensional vectors
- Lower silhouette scores (0.11-0.23)
- Demonstrates value of dimensionality reduction

## Step 5: Three Interesting Problems

### Problem 1: Document Similarity Analysis
**Question**: Can we identify students who submitted highly similar analyses?

**Method**:
- Calculated pairwise cosine similarity for all documents
- Identified top 10 most similar document pairs
- Visualized similarity distribution

**Findings**:
- Similarity scores range from 0.02 to 0.95
- Mean similarity: 0.21 (documents are generally diverse)
- Top similar pairs show similarity > 0.85
- Most similar pairs often come from:
  - Same student analyzing related topics
  - Different students following similar structured approaches
  - Common topics like "SQL" and "Linear Regression"

**Insights**:
- High diversity suggests original student thinking
- Similar pairs could indicate:
  - Collaborative learning
  - Common reference materials
  - Standard analytical frameworks

**Visualizations**:
- Histogram of similarity distribution
- Heatmap of top 30 most similar documents

3. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - PCA: Linear, fast, good for variance preservation
   - t-SNE: Non-linear, better visualization, computationally expensive

4. **Clustering**:
   - Lower-dimensional representations cluster better
   - Silhouette scores help validate cluster quality
   - Domain knowledge aids interpretation

### Domain Learnings:

1. **Course Structure**: Well-balanced coverage across ML fundamentals to advanced topics
